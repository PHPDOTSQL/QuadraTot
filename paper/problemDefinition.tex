\edit{write this.  Quadratot report section below}

We are testing several different learning methods to design a
parametrized gait for a quadruped robot from the Cornell Computational
Synthesis Lab.

The output each of the learning algorithms is a function of time,
$f(t)$, that outputs a vector of commanded motor positions.  This
function is generated using a parametrized motion model, described in
\secref{implement}.

The robot executes these commands and measures its change in location
using the tracking system described in \secref{implement}.  The input
to the learning algorithms is this measured displacement, which the
algorithms attempt to maximize. This displacement is measured for each
gait over a constant length run, usually 12 seconds.

A comparison and evaluation of the many different methods available
for optimizing the gait of legged robots will be useful for future
work on this challenging multidimensional control problem.
