\editbox{If we talk about past gait-learning work in here, is it a bit redundant?}

\edit{write this.  Old quadratot section below}



% Briefly explain who else worked on related problems in the past and what
% methods they used. Explain if you are using similar methods, or if your
% approach is different and if so - how (either is ok).


Various maching learning techniques have proven to be useful in
finding control policies for a wide variety of robots. Kohl and
Stone\cite{kohl} presented a policy gradient reinforcement learning
approach for generating a fast walk on legged robots. We experimented
with this method to create a walk for our robot (Policy Gradient
Descent). Chernova and Velosa\cite{chernova} took an evolutionary
approach to this problem which we did not implement.  Zykov, Bongard,
and Lipson\cite{zykov} describe the evolution of dynamic gaits on a
physical robot requiring no prior assumptions about the locomotion
pattern beyond the fact that it should be rhythmic.
