\section{Results and Discussion}

\edit{write this.}

% Present the quantitative results of your experiments. Graphical data
% presentation such as graphs and histograms are frequently better 
% than tables. Explain what are the basic differences revealed in the 
% data. If your method is stochastic or you analyze multiple datasets, 
% calculate mean and standard error for every quantitative
% performance result you show based on multiple runs.

We have done complete runs of 3 different initial parameter vectors
for random search, uniform random hill climbing, Gaussian random hill
climbing, policy gradient descent, Nelder-Mead simplex, and linear
regression.  We also evaluated the SVM regression and HyperNEAT
methods, but these methods were more experimental, and thus we do not
yet have the same volume of data for these runs.  We developed several
gaits that were about 4 times faster than the original hand-coded
gait.  Results are shown in \tabref{results_table}.

\begin{itemize}

\item For vector A, shown in \figref{vectorA}, linear regression
  worked significantly better than the other algorithms, resulting in
  a gait (27.58 body lengths/minute) that walked over twice as fast as
  the next best gait -- uniform random hill climbing at 11.37 body
  lengths/minute -- and 5.3 times better than the previous hand-coded
  gait.

\item Vector B, depicted in \figref{vectorB}, resulted in similarly
  performing gaits with all the algorithms. The random method got
  lucky and produced the best gait (17.26 body lengths/minute) and
  uniform random hill climbing produced the worst (9.44 body
  lengths/minute). The remaining algorithms each produced a gait
  around 13 body lengths/minute.

\item For vector C, shown in \figref{vectorC}, simplex and Gaussian
  random hill climbing each produced a gait that substantially
  outperformed the other algorithms. Simplex resulted in a gait of
  nearly 15 body lengths/minute and Gaussian random hill climbing
  produced a gait of just over 13 body lengths/minute, whereas the
  other algorithms returned gaits of less than 5 body lengths/minute.

\end{itemize}

Based on the three trials, as shown in \figref{std_error}, linear
regression worked the best, followed by simplex. Gaussian random hill
climbing performed about as well as random, but it is unclear whether
Gaussian would continue to improve and become much better than random
search if allowed to run for more iterations. Uniform random hill
climbing and policy gradient descent performed similarly to each other
on average, but differed greatly on individual runs.

In addition to running strategies to optimize parameterized gaits, we
also wanted to investigate the space of possible gaits.  To accomplish
this, we selected a parameter vector that resulted in motion, but not
an exceptional gait, and plotted performance along each dimension
individually.  In addition, we duplicated each measurement to be able
to estimate the measurement noise at each point.  Results for this
exploration are shown in \figref{explore_dim_1} through
\figref{explore_dim_5}.  As is shown in the figures, some dimensions
are smoother than others, and some measurements are fairly noisy.

\subsection{Discussion}
% Is your hypothesis supported? What conclusions do the results support
% about the strengths and weaknesses of your method compared to other 
% methods? How can the results be explained in terms of the underlying 
% properties of the algorithm and/or the data.

Because only three trials were tested with each algorithm and no
algorithm consistently outperformed the others, there is a large
standard error for each algorithm, as show in \figref{std_error}. For
this reason, it is unclear if any algorithm is superior to another in
this application. More trials with each algorithm would be necessary
to reach a definitive ranking of the performance of the algorithms.

However, each algorithm discovered at least one gait of over 10 body
lengths/minute, including random. For this reason, we speculate that
the motion model is at least as critical as the learning algorithm
used.
