\subsection{Exploration of Parameterized Gait Space}

Before optimizing the chosen family of parameterized gaits
(\secref{motionModel}) with learning methods, we performed an
experiment to explore the five dimensions of the SineModel5 parameter
space. Specifically, we selected a random parameter vector that
resulted in some motion, but not an exceptional gait. We then varied
each of the five parameters individually and measured performance,
repeating each measurement twice to get a rough estimate of the
measurement noise at each point.  The results of this exploration,
shown in \figref{explore_dim_1}, reveal that some dimensions ($\amp$,
$\tau$, $m_F$) are fairly smooth and exhibit global structure across
the allowable parameter range, while others ($m_O$, $m_R$) exhibit
more complex behavior.  In addition, it gives a rough indication that
measurement noise is often significant and is more likely to be large
for gaits that move more.  Of course, this is only a slice in each
dimension through a single point, and slices through a different point
could reveal different behavior.  The common point at the
intersection of all slices is shown as a red triangle in
each plot of \figref{explore_dim_1}.

\subsection{Learning Methods for Parameterized Gaits}

% Outline
% - beat hand gait
% - no learning strategy outperformed another by that much
% - real world noise yay

The results for the parameterized gaits are shown in
\figref{std_error} and \tabref{results}.  As a group, these strategies
produced results not significantly better than the randomly-generated
gaits, however, all methods managed to explore the space enough to
significantly improve on the previous hand coded gait in at least one
of the three runs.  No single strategy consistently outperformed the
others: for the first trial Linear Regression produced the fastest
gait at 27.58 body lengths/minute, for the second a random gait
actually won with 17.26 body lengths/minute, and for the third trial
the Nelder-Mead simplex method attained the fastest gait at 14.83 body
lengths/minute.

  strategy.}




\subsection{HyperNEAT Gaits}

The results for the gaits produced and evolved by HyperNEAT are shown
in \figref{hnResults} and \tabref{results}.  Overall the evolved gaits
were the fastest by far, beating all the parameterized models when
comparing either the average or the best gaits of each.

  a different low-dimensional parameterized motion model.}
