This paper presents an array of approaches to optimizing a quadrupedal
gait for forward speed.  We implement, test, and compare different
learning strategies including uniform and Gaussian random hill
climbing, policy gradient reinforcement learning,
Nelder-Mead simplex, new predictive methods based on linear
and support vector regression, and an evolved neural network
(HyperNEAT).  We compare results to a baseline random
search method.  Many of the methods resulted in walks significantly
faster than previously hand-tuned gaits.

%Because the fastest learned walk
%was not significantly faster than the fastest randomly generated walk,
%we conjecture that the motion representation for the robot is more
%integral to forward speed than the learning algorithm.
