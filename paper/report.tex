\section{Appendix}
% Describe the code files you uploaded into CMS

A brief description of the code uploaded to the CMS follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{optimize.py}: Main program, determines a strategy to try and runs the robot
  with that strategy.
\item \code{RunManager.py}: Deals with all the details of running the robot,
  including choosing an initial parameter, running the robot multiple times, 
  tracking distance walked, and writing to the log file. Also includes the
  \code{explore\_dimensions} method.
\item \code{Strategy.py}: Contains all the different possible strategies, which
  will be passed as objects in \code{optimize.py}. 
\item \code{Robot.py}: Implements the \code{Robot} class, described in
  \secref{implement}.
\item \code{SineModel.py}: Implements a sine based motion model,
  described in \secref{implement}.
\item \code{Motion.py}: Motion helper functions.
\item \code{WiiTrackServer.py}: Broadcasts the position of the infrared LED.
\item \code{WiiTrackClient.py}: Connects to the WiiTrackServer to get the current position information.
\end{itemize}
