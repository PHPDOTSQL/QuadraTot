HyperNEAT, used with a physical simulator, produced gaits that outperformed all previous gaits tried and recorded on the QuadraTot.\footnote{Videos of the gaits in simulation and on robot available at http://quadratot.yosinski.com}
The speed of the fastest gait recorded in this study was 14.5 cm/s, faster than the previously fastest gait published in Glette et al. \cite{glette}. 
Kyrre et al. \cite{glette} recorded 17.8 cm/s on their robot, but to make sure that there were no differences in robots, the same gait was also tested on the robot used for this study (which was the one used by Yosinski et al. \cite{yos:clune} and Shen et al. \cite{haocheng}. 
The same gait recorded an average speed of 12.951 cm/s and a maximum of 13.76 cm/s on our robot. We used these numbers in comparing results. 
The gait from this study outperformed the previous Kyrre et al's \cite{glette} gait by 5.4\% with much fewer evaluations performed per run, at 40000 evaluations per run as opposed to Kyrre et al's \cite{glette} 60000 evaluations per run.
It also outperformed the best gait evolved using HyperNEAT in hardware \cite{yos:clune} by 49.5\%, most likely due to the difference in the number of evaluations between the two studies -- 40000 vs 180. 
Another minor reason for superior performance may be that frequency limiter policy that we placed may have helped in producing gaits that were less susceptible to shutdown while Yosinski et al. \cite{yos:clune} did not have such things.
Although most gaits started off its evolution process by producing fast and high frequency gaits, with more generations, the gaits dramatically reduced its frequencies while continually increasing their fitness. The average frequency of the final gaits was 1.29 Hz per servo. 

%Gaits produced in this study confirmed that with the use of a physical simulator, HyperNEAT is able to fully exploit the geometry of the problem without human intervention, which was not evident in gait evolution using HyperNEAT in hardware \cite{yos:clune}. 
HyperNEAT took advantage of the regularity of the problem and produced gaits more regular, coordinated, and effective than all other gaits evolved for the QuadraTot platform in the past.
This is evident in the servo position plots where the gaits produced in this study are smooth and are similar between the servos. 
%The difference in regularity between the two studies is most likely due to the number of evaluations that were done in gait evolution. Additionally, the noise in the real world was extremely high, making learning in hardware difficult, which may have further impeded the search for higher-performing, regular gaits.

While this study was able to produce the highest fitness gait that has ever been tried on the QuadraTot, it is worth noting that most of the gaits in simulation did not transfer well to reality. 
Many gaits that performed very well in simulation performed poorly on the real robot because of the physical limitations and differences between simulation and real-world, such as limited servo power, frictional differences, and other minor differences in the robot physique, all of which accumulates to have a large impact in performance.
The most oft-seen problem with real trials, regardless of the actions taken to reduce it, was the servo shutdowns. 
Because we limited gait frequencies, HyperNEAT was forced to turn to other means for maximizing distance. 
So it pushed the servo positions to their limits by extending and retracting from one extreme to the other at a pace which was difficult for the servos to handle. 
Another reason for the shutdowns was that the servos could not easily support the robot's weight well, which often led to the servos shutting down after a few seconds of walking off-ground. 

These problems led to difficulties in repeatability. 
The robot is weak and the power of the motors changes between and even within trials. 
And since the gaits evolved in this study stressed the servos a lot, after one successful run, there was no guarantee that the robot would be able to perform that same gait succesfully next time. 
In that sense, the gaits produced in this study is perhaps worse than the gaits produced by RL PoWER Spline \cite{haocheng} or by genetic algorithm with a physical simulator \cite{glette} whose gaits were repeatable and less taxing on the robot.

%JMC All numbers in the same column should be to the same precision (e.g. for the real velocity column, one decimal place). Also, can you right-justify the numbers (while still keeping them roughly centered)? Comparing numbers that are not right-justified is hard...so if you can't center and right-justify, then I let's see if just having it be right justified is better.
