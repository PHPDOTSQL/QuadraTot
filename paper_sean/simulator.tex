The simulator\footnote{Available for Linux and Windows at http://quadratot.yosinski.com} used for this study was the same as the one used in Glette et al. \cite{glette}. The simulator is written in C++ using the Nvidia PhysX engine. The simulation captured the number and type of joints, mass, and rough shapes and lengths of the QuadraTot components to model the robot. Variables such as the friction coefficient were kept the same for this study. 
%Simulations occurred in C++ software customized for the in the NVIDIA PhysX physics simulator, as described previously \cite{glette}. 
%The simulator was visualized by OpenGL library to allow the user to have a more intuitive grasp of what is going on. %JMC Unnecessary detail since this paper is not about the simulator. 
%The simulator visualization included a recording feature which allows the user to create videos of the robot in simulation.%JMC: Assumed
%The simulator also features a command line function which allows the users to input a gait file and run it on the simulator. %JMC: Assumed
%The simulator then outputs a file containing the X, Y, Z coordinates of the center of mass of the robot over time. %JMC: Assumed
%In simulation, the robot traverses in the XY plane with the Z axis representing the height off the ground. %JMC Unnecessary detail
We implemented the initial cropping function in the simulator as in the actual robot but not the smart cropping function because with the smart cropping function implemented in simulation, there was too much limitation in the movements which drastically limited the possible gaits HyperNEAT could explore. %JMC/SL - Do all results in this paper reflect this? / They will soon.
%Although the simulator was originally written in Windows for the Windows operating platform we ported and ran it on Linux (Ubuntu 11.04) to seamlessly link the simulator and the already exising libraries together.

% and uses OpenGL and GLFW libraries for visualization. The simula- tor was originally written for the Windows operating system but was ported and run on Linux (Ubuntu 11.04) for this ex- periment. It features a commandline function which allows the user to specify a gait input file and extract an output file with the X, Y, Z coordinate information over time. The Eu- clidean distance travelled by the robot in the XY plane was used to calculate the speed of the robot in simulation and was used as the fitness value used for evolution.
