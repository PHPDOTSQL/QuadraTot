We performed the experiments on the QuadraTot quadrupedal robot platform~(\figref{quadratotWhiteBooties}).
It has 9 degrees-of-freedom (DOF): two joints per leg and one joint that allowed rotation along the robot's midline. %we def want a picture of the cool robot. I propose putting the picture of the robot on the left and the picture of the simulated robot on the right of the same figure. That also does a nice job of highlighting the theme of the paper (robot+sim) in one figure. Try to get this figure to show up as early as possible in the paper (e.g top of the 2nd page). 
The QuadraTot hardware designs and software for this project are open source\footnote{A list of all of the parts and all software, including the simulator, is available for free at http://creativemachines.cornell.edu/evolved-quadruped-gaits}, and all hardware components are either off-the-shelf or 3D printed parts. These traits enable other labs to perform research using the same platform, which eases comparison of different gait-learning algorithms. 
To date there are results on the platform from nine different learning algorithms from three previous publications~\cite{yos:clune,glette,haocheng}. We identified the robot's position using an infrared LED on the robot which was tracked using a Wiimote~\cite{yos:clune}.

Both in this work and that of Glette et al. 2012~\cite{glette}, the joints are powered by Robotis Dynamixel servos; five AX-18A servos for the inner joint of each leg and the single midline joint, and four AX-12A servos for the the outer joint of each leg, which requires less power and can thus have less expensive motors. The servos were sent new positions at 40Hz via the Pydynamixel library. 

Each servo has a built-in safety mechanism that shuts itself off to prevent damage if the servo's current, range, temperature, or torque was too high~\cite{robotis}. During evolution, this safety mechanism frequently activated, and did so inconsistently, adding significant noise to the evaluation process. As pointed out in a previous study~\cite{yos:clune}, \edit{is it better to say ``As pointed out in a previous study \cite{yos:clune}, gaits...'' SSL: Change made} gaits generated during evolution are highly variable and generate many shutdowns because they forced the servos to exert too much torque or command positions that are out of range. %JMC: Does requesting a value out of range really cause the servo to shut down? That seems like something we could easily fix (by never allowing an out-of-range value). Now that we do not allow values out of range, we still see lots of shutdowns...making me think that the problem was really torque. What do you think?
To prevent collisions between different pieces of the robot's body, we limited the allowable range of movement for the inner, outer, and hip joints to [-85\degree, +60\degree], [-113\degree, +39\degree], and [-28\degree, +28\degree], respectively. We also implemented the Smart Cropping System from Shen et al. 2012~\cite{haocheng}, which prevents combinations of joint positions for the inner and outer joint of each leg that generate extreme amounts of torque. A final method of reducing torque was to reduce the weight of the robot. Yosinski et al. 2011~\cite{yos:clune} had the small Linux computer that performed all computation on the robot, but we removed it and sent commands to the robot via a cable.
