\section{Team}

The human members of our team are Diana Hidalgo, Sarah Nguyen, and
Jason Yosinski.  The sole robotic member of our team is a 9 degree of
freedom starfish shaped robot from Hod Lipson's lab.



\section{Problem statement}

There has been much interest in and research surrounding legged
robots.  Such robots exhibit both challenges and opportunities not
present in more traditional wheeled robots.  One of these challenges
is getting the robot to move as quickly and efficiently as possible.
Past research has shown that machine learning methods of optimizing a
walking robot's gait can outperform even the best hand coded gaits
(Chernova 2004).

To this end, we will use machine learning to design a gait for a
quadraped robot, available from Hod Lipson's lab.  We anticipate using
speed and efficiency as metrics for evaluation of the designed gait;
these metrics are presented further in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}.

\section{I/O specification}


Input:

\begin{itemize}
\item Motor encoder position (optional, likely)
\item Motor force feedback (optional, likely)
\item Robot position estimate via external pose estimation system (optional, less likely)
\end{itemize}

 
\noindent Output:

\begin{itemize}
\item Motor position commands over time
\end{itemize}


\section{Background reading}

We have selected three papers to read for background information on
walking robots. The papers are \emph{An Evolutionary Approach to Gait
  Learning for Four-Legged Robots} by Sonia Chenova and Manuela
Veloso, \emph{Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning for Fast
  Quadrepedal Locomotion} by Nate Kohl and Peter Stone, and
\emph{Evolving Dynamic Gaits on a Physical Robot} by Viktor Zykov,
Josh Bongard, and Hod Lipson. Hopefully these papers will give us
insights on what kinds of algorithms and techniques to employ in our
learning problem.




\section{General approach}

\subsection{Where's the AI?}

Our general approach is still under development.  We are currently
evaluating the following AI methods for possible inclusion:

\begin{itemize}
\item Optimization (gradient descent, Levenberg-Marquardt, ...)
\item Evolutionary algorithm / Genetic algorithm
\item Reinforcement learning
\item Supervised learning?
\end{itemize}

In addition to these more general methods, the following issues will
also need to be investigated:

\begin{itemize}
\item Reduced dimensionality of parameter space (periodic, symmetric, ...)
\item Parametrized gait vs. non-parametrized gait (?)
\item Geometric constraints
\end{itemize}



\section{System architecture and work plan}

We will be working with a robot that has an on-board computer running Linux. The lower level drivers are in C and we hope to implement the system in Python.

Once we begin working with the robot and have an idea of the algorithm we will use, we will divide the work.

\section{Evaluation plans}
\label{sec:evaluation}

To evaluate our system, we will have three main metrics: speed, number
of failures, and efficiency, which will be compared to its initial
hard-coded walking, and compared to other quadraped robots in the lab:

\begin{itemize}
\item Speed taken to walk a certain distance
\item Number of failures (falling down, getting stuck) over a certain number of attempts
\item Efficiency and power consumption, estimated through a model of the motor
\end{itemize}
